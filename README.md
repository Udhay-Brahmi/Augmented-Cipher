# Augmented-Cipher

Augmented CipherAugmented Cipher
App name : Augmented-Cipher. 
Technologies include : Augmented reality, cryptography. 
Platform : Android. 
Tech used : Unity, Vuforia. 
Coding : C#

Description - 
This app is a good example of implementation of Cryptography concepts with Augmented reality. There will two options of key for decrypting/encrypting plaintext/cypher,
 1.) With manually written text.
 2.) With image of famous logo's(Make in india , Limca , Cocacola etc.)[Augmented reality] 

Technique used ::
~ Caesar cipher.
~ The key( Very hard to crack ) for different images is assigned inside app(By default). 

Tip for Hackers :: 
~ If you try brute force and scan each plain text given by each (key per second) then it is estimated that it would take approx 68+ years to find actual text.

 AIM ::
~ My main aim behind creating this app is, 
1.) To create a secure encryption/decryption method which is possible only with integration of augmented reality in cryptography.ðŸ’¥
2.) To polish my knowledge of cryptography.
